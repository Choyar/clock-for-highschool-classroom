# clock-for-highschool-classroom
This clock project was created for my highschool classroom, which had no clock in it, but had a big screen hanging beside the blackboard.

The clock will show analogical and digital forms of current time.

To open the setting menu, double click the background beside the circular analogical clock.

In setting menu, user can costomize the color of the clock, including the background color and/or the color of the analogical and digital clock, the color can be set either by three slider representing red, green and blue, or fill in the parameter directly.

Next to the color setting, user can choose how they want to present the digital clock, the choices include: decimal, quaternary,octal,hexadecimal, banary-coded decimal and gray code, ASCII is also an option but unfortunately no one can understand what it means.

And then there is a count down function which will start the countdown 1 minute before the class end, and can be manually tuned to offset the gap between local time and the school's system's time. note: this function can be turn off at any time.

The last but not least is the random color function, when turned on and the bar under the switch is clicked, the whole screen will start blinking like a disco ball. note: do not turn this function on during class, teacher will not be happy.
